## **Usage**

---

The best way to use this web app is by visiting it yourself! You can navigate to the page by clicking the link <a href="https://coderbennett.github.io/web-portfolio/" target="_blank">here</a>.

When you visit the page you will see a navbar with links to different sections of the page as well as a link to view a PDF of my resume.

As displayed in the animation above, clicking on the links will navigate you to the corresponding location on the page. This page is mobile first but it will also present well on the desktop version.

---

Below the about section you will find a projects section with recently developed projects. This section is generated iteratively within my script file, and could easily be updated with new projects.

![User navigates to the projects section](assets/media/projects.gif)

Each project is displayed in a card element. There are buttons to navigate to the github repository for the app as well as a link to the deployed app.

---

There are many extra features added to this site, including the scroll reveal technology.

![User clicks button to change theme of the website](assets/media/themeChanger.gif)

As shown in the above animation, there is a button in the navbar which will change the site's theme from light to dark. This also will save to local storage so when the user returns to the site it will maintain their previous selection.
